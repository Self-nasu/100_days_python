## What is Python üêç ?

It is a programming language like other languages which gives us a way to communicate with computers with the help of ideas.

Ideas are the "commands" that people use to communicate with a computers üíª.


### First Program

- Just try this to run this program on your Python IDE

```python
my_name = "Naman Jain"
print("Hello and welcome" + my_name + "!!")
```

<h3 style="color: blue;">Comments in Python</h3>

- We can write comments in python for making code eassy to understand by the programmer

python doesnot interpret any comments and do not compile them and give output of this lines

we use "#" in python for comments

```python
# This is a python comment
# Also this line not give any output
# print("naman jain")
```
- Also we can write multi line comments in python using single or double quotes like  

```python
'''
this is muliti line comment
hey my name is naman jain
what is your name buddy.
'''
```
```python
"""
this is muliti line comment
hey my name is naman jain
what is your name buddy.
"""
```

<h3 style="color: yellow;">Modules in python</h3>

 A module is like a Code library which can be used to borrow the code written by somebody else which can use in our python program.

There are two type of Modules in python
- Built-In module (don't need to install)
- External module (needed to install using pip or conda)

### How to install any module in python ?

Ans: using "pip install" cmd

```python
pip install pandas
```
In this pandas in external module name

This cmd should be done before going into python console.
